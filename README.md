# bashEM

A seemingly random mixture of shell scripts for EM-related software packages. 

To the best of my abilities I have tried to group them to fit their application in handling files from different EM-related software packages. 
Almost all of these scripts invoke an IMOD function call, so it is best to have those on the PATH. 
Metadata parsing is generally performed with just awk/shell commands. 
Plotting scripts typically use gnuplot and Eye of Gnome for display. 


## How to run
-Add the directories to your PATH for ease of use.
-Running of any (most?) scripts without any command-line arguements should printout the usage (some better than others).


## Known issues
-All of these scripts can be deemed as "works-in-progress", so use if you find them helpful but don't have too high of hopes for them. 
-I am not great the using git.
